Input file:
- Each input file contains one test case.
- The first line contains two integers N the number of nodes, and M the number of edges.
- Following M lines, each line contains three integers U, V, and C describing an edge from node U to node V with cost C.
- Each pair of nodes are connected with AT MOST one edge.
- There is no edge from a node to itself.
- Edges are undirected.

Output file:
- The only line in the output file contains the total weight of MST.
